        "This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing hotel booking information to gain insights and understand patterns in customer behaviour, booking trends, and other relevant factors that impact the hospitality industry. By conducting a comprehensive EDA, we intend to extract meaningful information that can guide decision-making, improve customer experience, and optimise hotel management strategies.\n",

        "**Customer Segmentation:-** Based on the analysis, we will attempt to segment customers into different groups based on their booking behaviors, demographics, and preferences. This can help in tailoring marketing strategies and service offerings to specific customer segments."
