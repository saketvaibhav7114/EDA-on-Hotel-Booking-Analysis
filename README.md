# EDA-on-Hotel-Booking-Analysis
**Project Summary -**
This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing hotel booking information to gain insights and understand patterns in customer behaviour, booking trends, and other relevant factors that impact the hospitality industry. By conducting a comprehensive EDA, we intend to extract meaningful information that can guide decision-making, improve customer experience, and optimise hotel management strategies.

**Objectives::**

Data Collection and Description:- The project begins with the collection of a comprehensive dataset from various sources, such as hotel reservation systems, customer databases, and online booking platforms. The dataset includes a wide range of attributes, such as customer demographics, booking dates, room types, booking channels, length of stay, cancellations, special requests, and historical hotel performance metrics.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:- The collected data undergoes a rigorous preprocessing phase to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Data cleaning techniques are applied to ensure data integrity and accuracy. Irrelevant or redundant features may be removed, and categorical variables are encoded appropriately for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):- The heart of the project lies in conducting an extensive EDA to extract meaningful insights and patterns from the dataset. The EDA process includes various analytical techniques and visualizations, such as statistical summaries, histograms, box plots, scatter plots, heatmaps, and time-series analyses.

Customer Segmentation:- Based on the analysis, we will attempt to segment customers into different groups based on their booking behaviors, demographics, and preferences. This can help in tailoring marketing strategies and service offerings to specific customer segments.
