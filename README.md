# EDA-on-Hotel-Booking-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a hotel booking analysis dataset is a crucial initial step in comprehensively understanding the data. It encompasses a range of essential activities such as data summary, visualization, statistical analysis, and data cleaning. By visually exploring the dataset through various charts and graphs, one can unveil hidden patterns, distributions, and potential outliers. 

Additionally, calculating descriptive statistics offers insights into the dataset's central tendencies and spread. EDA also involves handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers to ensure data integrity. It may entail feature engineering to extract more meaningful information and correlation analysis to determine relationships between variables. Categorical data, like customer types and room categories, is analyzed through frequency tables and visualizations. Time series analysis can be useful for tracking booking trends and seasonality.  

Furthermore, EDA on a hotel booking analysis dataset can shed light on customer preferences, seasonal variations in bookings, and the impact of various factors on reservation cancellations. It can provide hoteliers and stakeholders with actionable insights for better pricing strategies, allocation of resources, and marketing efforts. By visualizing the data and uncovering patterns, EDA allows one to identify trends and potential areas for improvement, contributing to enhanced customer satisfaction and overall business success in the competitive hospitality sector. It is a foundational step for data-driven decision-making and plays a pivotal role in transforming raw data into actionable intelligence for hotels and resorts.
